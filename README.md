Chatbots are conversational agents  designed with the help of AI (Artificial Intelligence) software. They simulate a conversation (or a chat) with users in a natural language via messaging applications, websites, mobile apps, or phone (Irsath, 2021). Building a chatbot involves several key steps and can be approached in different ways. The best approach for building a chatbot depends on your specific needs and goals, and factors such as the complexity of the task and the desired level of sophistication should be taken into consideration. 

Memory Networks are a type of neural network architecture specifically designed to handle tasks that require the ability to store and retrieve information from a large dataset. This makes them particularly well-suited for chatbots, which often need to remember and process large amounts of information from previous conversations. 

Memory networks for Question-Answering Memory networks are a general class of neural network models for natural language understanding (NLU) tasks introduced by Weston et al. in 2014 in the context of end-to-end trained QA systems. In this project, we will apply the NLU QA task and a class of deep learning models known as memory networks to build a chatbot that can carry out multi-turn conversations, adapt to context, and handle a variety of topics.

Project Objectives include: (1) Examining the various components of an end-to-end trained chatbot models; and (2) Explore the challenges faced with using architectures like Seq2Seq, Transformers, GPT and deep learning

## Dataset
The Cornell Movie Dialogue Corpus contains a metadata-rich collection of fictional conversations extracted from raw movie scripts: 
- 220,579 conversational exchanges between 10,292 pairs of movie characters
- involves 9,035 characters from 617 movies
- in total 304,713 utterances
- gender (for 3,774 characters)
- position on movie credits (3,321 characters)
