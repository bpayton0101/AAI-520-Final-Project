## Introduction

Chatbots are conversational agents  designed with the help of AI (Artificial Intelligence) software. They simulate a conversation (or a chat) with users in a natural language via messaging applications, websites, mobile apps, or phone (Irsath, 2021). Chatbots have become very popular tools ever since deep learning became popular. Thanks to deep learning, we're now able to train the bot to provide better and personalized questions, and, in the last implementation, to retain a per-user context (Byiringiro et al, 2018). 

Building a chatbot involves several key steps and can be approached in different ways. The best approach for building a chatbot depends on your specific needs and goals, and factors such as the complexity of the task and the desired level of sophistication should be taken into consideration. 

The goal of this project is to build a chatbot that can carry out multi-turn conversations, adapt to context, and handle a
variety of topics, via web or app interface where users can converse with the chatbot. This project will use the Cornell Movie Dialogs Corpus to examine generative-based chatbot architectures like Seq2Seq, Transformers, Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT) and deep learning. 

Project Pre-requisites:
	• Basic understanding of deep learning and neural networks
 
	• Familiarity with a deep learning framework (e.g., TensorFlow, PyTorch)
 
	• Basic knowledge of web development (for the interface)

Project Phases:
	• Research and Study Phase
 
	• Data Collection and Preprocessing
 
	• Model Design and Training
 
 	• Evaluation





## Dataset
The Cornell Movie Dialogue Corpus contains a metadata-rich collection of fictional conversations extracted from raw movie scripts: 
- 220,579 conversational exchanges between 10,292 pairs of movie characters
- involves 9,035 characters from 617 movies
- in total 304,713 utterances
- gender (for 3,774 characters)
- position on movie credits (3,321 characters)
